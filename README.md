# vb-objects
This is a slowly growing collection of externals made for the programming environment MaxMSP (www.Cycling74.com).

###### Steps to compile:

- create a directory, name it, as you like
- copy a 'c74support' folder from a recent Max SDK into it, e.g. from here
https://github.com/Cycling74/max-sdk
- on the same directory level copy the vb-objects folder
- step into vb-objects and build each individual project

Compiled objects for osx can be found here: https://vboehm.net/downloads
